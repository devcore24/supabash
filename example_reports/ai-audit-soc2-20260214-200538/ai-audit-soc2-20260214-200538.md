## Summary
The localhost environment exposes multiple unauthenticated administrative/metrics endpoints and Supabase secrets, including a service role key, creating immediate risk of full database access, user enumeration, and sensitive configuration disclosure. Several data services (Postgres/Redis/metrics) are reachable and some listen on wildcard interfaces, increasing the attack surface.

### Notes
- ffuf fallback (after gobuster failure) ran and found 0 paths across 1 target(s): http://localhost:8080 (0).
- agentic ffuf action(s) ran and found 0 paths across 1 target(s): http://localhost:3001 (0).

### LLM Usage
- total_tokens=8211
- cost_usd=0.029976
- provider=openai
- model=gpt-5.2

### Findings
- **CRITICAL** Supabase service role key exposed (credential/secrets leakage)
  - Evidence: Supabase audit detected service role JWT in content: key=eyJhbG….sig, source=http://localhost:4001
  - Recommendation: Rotate the service role key immediately, remove it from any client-accessible responses/assets, and restrict usage to trusted server-side components only.
- **HIGH** Prometheus accessible without authentication (config exposure)
  - Evidence: Prometheus config endpoint reachable: http://localhost:9090/api/v1/status/config (HTTP 200); nuclei also flagged unauth Prometheus at the same endpoint
  - Recommendation: Require authentication/authorization for Prometheus UI and APIs, and restrict access via firewall/allowlist (bind to localhost or internal network only).
- **HIGH** Supabase REST API accessible without authentication / potential missing RLS
  - Evidence: REST endpoint reachable without auth: http://localhost:4001/rest/v1/ (HTTP 200); tool notes 'RLS may be disabled'
  - Recommendation: Enable and verify Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables, ensure policies are least-privilege, and require appropriate API keys/JWT auth for data access.
- **HIGH** Unauthenticated Supabase RPC allows user enumeration
  - Evidence: RPC callable without auth: http://localhost:4001/rest/v1/rpc/list_users (HTTP 200)
  - Recommendation: Restrict RPC execution to authenticated roles, add explicit role checks within functions, and ensure underlying tables/views are protected by RLS/policies.
- **MEDIUM** Unauthenticated metrics endpoints exposed
  - Evidence: Metrics accessible: http://localhost:8080/metrics (HTTP 200) and http://localhost:9090/metrics (HTTP 200); nuclei detected Prometheus metrics endpoints
  - Recommendation: Protect metrics with authentication and/or network segmentation; avoid exposing metrics publicly as they can leak internal topology, versions, and operational data.
- **MEDIUM** Redis reachable without authentication
  - Evidence: readiness_probe: redis-cli PING returned PONG for localhost:6379
  - Recommendation: Enable Redis AUTH/ACLs, bind to localhost/internal interfaces, and enforce firewall rules to prevent untrusted network access.
  - Compliance Mapping:
    - Potential Gap: SOC 2 CC6.1 (Logical Access) (mapping confidence: high)
  - Mapping Basis: corroborated by readiness_probe findings
  - Evidence Artifacts: `evidence/results/025-readiness_probe.json`
  - Manifest Reference: `evidence/manifest.json`
- **MEDIUM** Sensitive services listening on wildcard interfaces (increased exposure)
  - Evidence: ss -lnt shows wildcard listeners on ports: 5432, 6379, 8080, 9090, 9100
  - Recommendation: Bind services to localhost/internal interfaces where possible and enforce host/network firewall policies to limit access to trusted sources only.
- **MEDIUM** Directory listing / sensitive configuration path detected
  - Evidence: nuclei: Sensitive Configuration Files Listing - Detect at http://localhost:3001/config/
  - Recommendation: Disable directory listing, remove sensitive files from web roots, and restrict access to configuration endpoints/paths.
- **LOW** Go pprof debug endpoint exposed
  - Evidence: nuclei: http://localhost:9090/debug/pprof/heap?debug=1
  - Recommendation: Disable pprof in production or restrict it to localhost/admin networks with authentication to prevent information leakage and potential DoS vectors.
- **LOW** Supabase anon key exposed in client content
  - Evidence:
    - Supabase audit detected anon JWT in content: key=eyJhbG….sig, source=http://localhost:4001
    - supabase_audit: key=eyJhbG….sig, source=http://localhost:4001
  - Recommendation: Treat anon keys as public but ensure RLS and policies prevent data exposure; rotate if mistakenly granted elevated privileges and minimize scope/permissions.
  - Compliance Mapping:
    - Potential Gap: SOC 2 CC6.8 (Data Classification & Protection) (mapping confidence: medium)
  - Mapping Basis: corroborated by supabase_audit findings
  - Evidence Artifacts: `evidence/results/024-supabase_audit.json`
  - Manifest Reference: `evidence/manifest.json`

## Methodology
- Baseline: deterministic evidence collection with scope controls and safe defaults.
- Agentic expansion: tool-calling planner proposes additional evidence collection within allowed scope.
- Compliance profile: SOC 2 Type II
- Compliance focus: Security and availability controls with evidence of exposure management and vulnerability assessment.

## Scope & Assumptions
- In scope: localhost, http://localhost:19090, http://localhost:44427, http://localhost:5670, http://localhost:4001, http://localhost:44717, http://localhost:9417, http://localhost:8080 ...
- Authentication context: unauthenticated network/web checks unless explicitly configured otherwise.
- Control mapping note: mapped controls indicate potential relevance and require manual validation.
- Localhost limitation: this run cannot validate external exposure paths or network segmentation boundaries.
- Out of scope: independent attestation/certification decisions and control operation effectiveness testing.

## Compliance Coverage Matrix
| Control Area | Status | Evidence Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Security Surface Inventory | Covered | nmap, httpx, whatweb | basis=corroborated_findings; based on successful tool runs |
| Vulnerability & Misconfiguration Checks | Partial | nuclei, gobuster, ffuf | basis=corroborated_findings; skipped: sqlmap (No parameterized URL provided (include '?' in target URL)) |
| Encryption/Transport Control Review | Partial | nmap | basis=corroborated_findings; skipped: sslscan (No TLS candidate ports detected from discovery) |
| Access Control Exposure Review | Partial | readiness_probe, nuclei, supabase_audit | basis=corroborated_findings; based on successful tool runs |

- Status legend: `Covered` = mapped checks succeeded with corroborating evidence, `Partial` = some mapped checks/evidence present, `Not Assessed` = no successful mapped checks or signal was inconclusive.

## Not Assessable Automatically
- The following areas require manual validation, process evidence, or third-party assessment:
- Policy design/effectiveness over the audit period (not point-in-time scan evidence).
- Access review governance (JML workflow approvals and periodic recertifications).
- Change management control operation evidence (tickets, approvals, segregation).
- Incident response process effectiveness and tabletop/drill execution records.

- decision_steps: 1
- planner: tool_calling

### Decision Trace Highlights
- step 1: executed
  - initial_candidate: tool=ffuf target=http://localhost:3001 priority=10
  - selected_action: ffuf target=http://localhost:3001

### Actions
- ffuf target=http://localhost:3001 profile=compliance_soc2: success
  - Rationale: SOC 2 evidence goal: demonstrate ongoing vulnerability assessment and exposure management by validating whether previously identified sensitive areas (e.g., /config/, /README.md, /robots.txt) extend to additional undiscovered unauthenticated endpoints on the primary app. A focused content discovery run on the main web app can uncover admin panels, backups, or configuration artifacts that materially change risk posture and remediation scope.

## Recommended Next Actions
1. Restrict monitoring/debug endpoints to trusted admin or monitoring networks only; add authentication/authorization controls where supported.
2. Reduce attack surface by closing unused listeners and rebinding critical services from wildcard interfaces to least-privilege network zones.
3. Limit PostgreSQL exposure to required application hosts and enforce strong auth/TLS policies for database connectivity.
4. Harden Redis: require authentication/ACLs, bind to localhost or private interfaces, and block untrusted network access at the firewall.
5. Collect SOC 2 control-operation evidence not assessable by scanning (JML/access reviews, change approvals, incident response drills, and policy governance records).
6. After remediation, rerun the readiness assessment and compare deltas in findings severity, exposed services, and evidence artifacts.
